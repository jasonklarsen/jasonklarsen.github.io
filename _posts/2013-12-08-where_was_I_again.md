As I write this post, I come off a month-long hiatus where family holidays and end-of-year work obligations came and went. During this time, I didn't spend any time focused on my personal project ([resonance][res]), nor the blog. I did have the foresight to use my favorite coding trick to bookmark exactly where I was:

*At the end of the coding session, write a broken test that tell you where to begin next time.*

In my case, I have a few git repos to choose from, and I couldn't remember what I was in the middle of doing. So, I just ran tests in each project until I found the failing tests. Then as soon as I read the errors... BAM! My context returned. When it is only a couple days between sessions, I can often remember where to pick up, but in this case of weeks, I totally forgot.

I find this a less stressful form of the [Zeigarnik effect][zeigarnik], which is basically the idea that incomplete tasks "stick in the mind" easier than complete tasks. (I do use this effect to focus my mind on current projects. It is good for when I have time to think, but not to type, e.g. when I am on the train or out for a walk.) 

Now, I don't want to take full credit for this broken test trick. I am pretty sure that I was suggested to me many years ago. [Here it is][trick] on a list of TDD best practices.
